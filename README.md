NLP Tasks to work with text and a sample Sentiment Analysis project on Amazon Mobile Reviews 

NLP Tutorial Notebook:
I have tried to cover all the basic tasks that will help you to start off working with text data. I have also written a few lines of RegEx code.
Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the re module. 
Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like. 
You can then ask questions such as “Does this string match the pattern?”, or “Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?”. You can also use REs to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways.


Sentiment Analysis Amazon Notebook
Here, I have used Logistic Regression and XGBoost to predict the sentiment of the review as positive or negative.
I then used the AUC score to evaluate my models. I am still working on improving the models and will be updating the notebooks with the same.
I have also explained the use of Bag of Words approach(Count Vectorize), Tf-idf and n-grams approach. 

Future scope is to use different boosting algorithms and a neural network to improve the auc score. I may use other evaluation scores also.
